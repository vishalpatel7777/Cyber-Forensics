== Executive Summary

[quote, "Modern Definition (2025)"]
____
Digital forensics is the scientific acquisition, preservation, examination, and analysis of digital evidence to reconstruct events and support legal, administrative, or intelligence investigations.
____

Cybercrime today spans unauthorized access, fraud, deception, cyber-violence, data theft, cloud intrusion, AI-assisted attacks, and exploitation of IoT and critical infrastructure.

Digital Forensics enables investigators to:

* identify attacker systems,
* reconstruct timelines,
* recover deleted or volatile evidence,
* maintain legality through Chain of Custody,
* produce defensible reports for use in court or incident response.

The modern forensic pipeline remains built on four stages:

. **Collection** – Acquire volatile → non-volatile data.
. **Examination** – Reduce dataset to relevant scope.
. **Analysis** – Correlate evidence and reconstruct events.
. **Reporting** – Document findings for technical & legal stakeholders.

'''

== Part I: Understanding Cybercrime

=== 1. Definitions

* **Cyber:** Relating to digital systems, networks, cloud, virtualized infrastructure, and inter-connected devices.
* **Crime:** Any unlawful act or omission.
* **Cybercrime:** Any crime involving a computer, digital system, network, or cloud resource.

=== 2. Role of Computers in Cybercrime

==== Computer as a Target
Attacks on servers, endpoints, IoT devices, SCADA/ICS, cloud workloads, or containers.

Examples:

* DDoS on critical servers  
* Ransomware encrypting storage  
* Cloud account takeover  

==== Computer as a Tool
The attacker uses a device or platform to commit a crime.

Examples:

* Threat emails  
* Phishing campaigns  
* Remote exploitation  
* OSINT misuse  

=== 3. Modern Categories of Cybercrime (2025)

==== Cyber Trespass
Unauthorized access across digital boundaries.  
Examples: Wi-Fi hacking, cloud privilege escalation, container escape.

==== Cyber Deception
Fraud via phishing, smishing, deepfake impersonation, AI-crafted emails.

==== Cyber Violence
Disruption of societal or critical functions:

* DDoS  
* ICS/SCADA compromise  
* Power grid or water plant tampering  
* Supply chain attacks  

'''

== Part II: Discipline of Digital Forensics

Digital forensic science focuses on:

* identifying evidence,  
* acquiring it safely,  
* analyzing logs, memory, and systems,  
* producing legally-defensible findings.

=== 1. Branches of Digital Forensics (Updated for 2025)

* **Computer Forensics** – Windows, Linux, macOS, container forensics  
* **Mobile Forensics** – Android/iOS, encrypted messaging, app artifacts  
* **Network Forensics** – Firewall logs, PCAPs, cloud flow logs  
* **Cloud Forensics (New Standard)** – AWS, Azure, GCP audit logs  
* **IoT & Hardware Forensics** – Embedded devices, routers, firmware  
* **Memory Forensics** – RAM, volatile artifacts, live response  
* **Malware Forensics** – Reverse engineering binaries, malware tracing  

'''

== Part III: The Four-Stage Forensic Investigation Process


=== Stage 1: Collection

Goal: Acquire complete and accurate evidence without altering it.

==== Volatile vs Non-Volatile Data

* **Volatile Data** (RAM, live connections) – lost on shutdown.  
* **Non-Volatile Data** (disks, cloud logs) – persistent.

==== Modern Order of Volatility (2025)

. Memory (RAM, volatile artifacts)
. Running processes + handle tables
. Open network connections
. Logged-in sessions + tokens
. Cloud activity logs (AWS CloudTrail, Azure ActivityLogs)
. Disk images
. Backups and snapshots (VM, container, cloud volume snapshots)

==== Initial Actions (Updated)

* Computers → Isolate from network; DO NOT shut down.  
* Cloud Systems → Snapshot instances, export audit logs.  
* Mobiles → Airplane mode ON without removing SIM/eSIM.  
* Containers → Pause container, export runtime state.  

[IMPORTANT]
====
Never run tools that modify timestamps, metadata, or memory structure on the affected machine.
====

'''

=== Stage 2: Examination

Focus: Reduce raw data → relevant evidence.

Techniques include:

* keyword/indicator filtering  
* attacker-IP isolation  
* log correlation  
* hash comparison  
* extraction of artifacts (registry, browser, session tokens, syslogs)

'''

=== Stage 3: Analysis

Goal: Reconstruct what happened.

Tasks:

* Identify attacker path  
* Build event timeline  
* Correlate host, network, and cloud data  
* Identify individuals/systems involved  
* Decode malware or scripts  
* Understand motive, method, and impact  

Analysis uses:

* Timeline reconstruction tools  
* Correlation graphs  
* Volatility/Redline (memory)  
* PCAP analysis  
* SIEM-based correlation (Splunk/ELK/Wazuh)  

'''

=== Stage 4: Reporting

Report must include:

* Objective and summary  
* All evidence sources  
* Tools used  
* Hash values  
* Steps taken  
* Legal constraints or gaps  
* Recommendations  

Audience-based:

* **Technical** → logs, artifacts, processes  
* **Management** → business risk, impact, remediation  

'''

== Part IV: Evidence Management & Chain of Custody

=== 1. Chain of Custody (CoC)

Formal record:

* who collected evidence  
* when it was collected  
* how it was stored  
* hash values for verification  
* transfer and access logs  

[example,title="Sample CoC Entry"]
====
Item: Disk Image  
Hash: SHA-256 (auto-generated)  
Collected By: Investigator #21  
Transferred To: Lab Storage  
Timestamp: 2025-11-22  
====

'''

=== 2. Good Evidence Principles (Modernized)

. **Work only on a forensic copy**  
. **Create bit-by-bit / sector-by-sector images**  
. **Use hardware write-blockers**  
. **Preserve original media with tamper-evident bags**  
. **Document EVERYTHING**  
. **Maintain order of volatility**  
. **Generate cryptographic hash (SHA-256 preferred)**  

'''

== Part V: Modern Investigation Strategy (2025)

A professional forensic operation requires:

. Understand objectives (attack intent, impact, timeline).  
. Assess environment (cloud, hybrid, container, mobile).  
. Identify evidence sources (endpoints, SIEM, firewalls, cloud).  
. Estimate evidence value (direct > indirect).  
. Prioritize based on volatility + relevance.  
. Plan acquisition carefully (20–30% of total time).

[TIP]
====
Today's investigations require cloud-native evidence (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, Azure Sign-ins) as mandatory sources.

== Analogy: Digital Forensics Like Archaeology

[sidebar,title="Analogy"]
****
Digital forensics resembles archaeological excavation:

* Instead of soil → logs, memory, packets  
* Instead of bones → artifacts, deleted files  
* Instead of carbon dating → timestamps & hashes  

Just as archaeologists preserve the original site, forensic experts always work on a **bit-by-bit copy**.
****

'''

== Final Insights

CAUTION:   Any alteration to original evidence can invalidate the entire investigation.
 
TIP:  Modern attacks require combining endpoint, network, and cloud evidence.

NOTE: Forensics today is not just digital—it is multidisciplinary: cloud, AI artifacts, memory, logs, containers, and human behavior.
